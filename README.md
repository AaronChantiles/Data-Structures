# Data-Structures
This data structure project uses JavaScript to explore all of the instantiation patterns from functional to pseudoclassical, and then uses those patterns to create data structure classes. Those classes include Trees, Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs, Sets and Linked Lists.
